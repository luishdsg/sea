## Frontend: React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

#### `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

#### `yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

#### `yarn eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
